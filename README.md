# Japan Regional Data Visualizer

## Description

A web app to explore Japan's regional data provided by [RESAS](https://resas.go.jp).

Select a prefecture from the dropdown to display regional demographic data.

You can also look into the regional diversity for years 2011~2018 for the selected prefecture, either in a pie chart or a bar graph.

## Status

It is currently deployed on [Heroku] 💻(https://japan-regional-data.herokuapp.com/). There's still some things I would like to add in the future, but the app itself is running and functioning.

## Tech & Tools

- Vanilla JS 🔨
- Bootstrap ([Bootswatch Minty Theme](https://bootswatch.com/minty/))
- HTML5
- express

## TODO list

- Toggle between Japanese and English 🌏
- Refactor API requests to move them to the backend and use config vars (after I learn how) 🔨

## Special Thanks
